This is a pretty straight forward bot.
You can use it to keep your free minecraft servers online 24/7.
I reccomend using replit to clone the repo and run the files (afkbot.js and keepalive.js) using a workflow
You can use it locally as well
Configure the config file to suit your needs
Only limitation is you will have to use admin on your minecraft server to register the bot with the password in the config file.
For AuthMe users, command looks like:
/authme reg <your_bot_username> <password_from_config>


Please note:
Usable only on cracked servers, and this can get you banned on aternos.
